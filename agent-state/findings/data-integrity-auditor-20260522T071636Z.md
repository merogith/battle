**Title**: `No Item` sentinel string used in 11 build slots is absent from `data/items.json`

**Evidence**:
```json
"Vileplume": { "nu": { "Defensive": {"item": ["Black Sludge", "No Item"], ...} } }
"Ninjask":   { "pu": { "Swords Dance": {"item": ["Heavy-Duty Boots", "No Item"], ...} } }
"Giratina":  { "godlygift": { "Wall": {"item": ["Leftovers", "No Item"], ...} } }
```

**Repro**: `node scripts/debug/data-validator.mjs` reports `[P1] 1 items referenced by builds are missing from items.json — No Item (11 build(s))`. Affects gen8.json (6) and gen9.json (5).

**Blast radius**: When `makeBuild` rolls a slot whose `item` array picks `"No Item"`, the mon's `item` becomes the literal string `"No Item"`. The engine handles this as a sentinel (`battle.html` lines 13134-13136 fall through to `'No Item'` as a default), so combat works. But: the tooltip dictionary populated from `items.json` has no entry, so any UI showing the mon's held item will not render a tooltip, and any code that does `itemsJSON[norm('No Item')]` for legality/effects gets `undefined` and may treat it as a missing entry.

**Fix sketch**: Either (a) add a single placeholder entry in `data/items.json` (gen 1, `name: "No Item"`, `shortDesc: "No held item."`) so consumers can look it up uniformly, or (b) migrate the 11 build slots to use `null` / omit the alternative entirely and document that "no held item" is encoded as absence rather than a sentinel string. Option (b) is more invasive but cleaner.

**Verification**: Re-run `node scripts/debug/data-validator.mjs`; the missing-items finding should drop to 0. Spot-check a build that previously had `"No Item"` in its item array (e.g., Vileplume `nu/Defensive`) and confirm the rolled mon gets the alternative held item when "No Item" was selected.

**Title**: `???` type used by gen1 `bide` and gen4 `curse` is not defined in `typeChart`

**Evidence**:
```js
// battle.html ~9941
const typeChart={"Normal":{...},"Fire":{...}, ... /* 18 entries, no "???" */};

// data/moves.json gen4.curse
{ "type": "???", "desc": "If the user is not a Ghost type, lowers Speed by 1 stage ..." }
```

**Repro**: `node -e "const moves=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/home/user/battle/data/moves.json','utf8')); for (const g of Object.keys(moves)) for (const k of Object.keys(moves[g])) if (moves[g][k].type==='???') console.log(g,k);"` prints `1 bide` and `4 curse`. Grep the typeChart literal: `???` is absent.

**Blast radius**: The live engine only loads gen9 moves (`movesJSONOrig['9']`), where `curse` is `Ghost` and `bide` is `Normal`, so today the runtime never observes a `???` type. However, any tooling that reads earlier gens from `moves.json` (e.g., a dex/format browser, a learnset preview that walks the inheritance chain) will look up `typeChart["???"]` and receive `undefined`, causing all subsequent damage-multiplier math to fall back to `1` silently. This is also a load-bearing assumption for any future gen-toggle feature.

**Fix sketch**: Either remove the gen4 `curse.type === "???"` data (replacing it with the Showdown-canonical `Normal` typing it had in gen4) or add a `"???"` entry to `typeChart` with all neutral (`1×`) effectiveness so legacy-data consumers don't get `undefined`. The first option matches engine behavior; the second preserves the original Showdown export verbatim.

**Verification**: After the fix, `Object.keys(typeChart).includes('???')` is true (option B) or `moves.json` has no `???` types (option A). Either way, `node scripts/debug/data-validator.mjs` should pass without warnings about the typeless move.

**Title**: Validator reports 6925 "CSV alternative" occurrences but every build file uses arrays — false positive

**Evidence**:
```js
function expandCommaAlternatives(value) {
  if (!value) return [];
  if (Array.isArray(value)) return value.flatMap(expandCommaAlternatives);  // ← recurses into array
  return String(value).split(',').map(s => s.trim()).filter(Boolean);
}
// caller:
const alternatives = expandCommaAlternatives(raw);
if (alternatives.length > 1) commaAlternativeFields++;  // ← counts array len > 1 as CSV
```

**Repro**: `for f in data/builds/gen*.json; do node -e "..."; done` confirms zero comma-separated `item`/`ability`/`nature` strings across all six files; the schema is uniformly array-based. The validator output `Build alternative format is inconsistent — moves use array literals, ability/item/nature use comma-separated strings (6925 occurrences)` is therefore misleading.

**Blast radius**: Anyone who reads the data-integrity report (including this auditor) gets a P2 inconsistency claim that doesn't exist. Wastes triage cycles. The validator also undercounts genuine CSV-encoded slots if any are added in the future, because the array path is taken first.

**Fix sketch**: In `expandCommaAlternatives`, only increment `commaAlternativeFields` when the input was a string containing a comma. Restructure so the CSV-vs-array classification is made on the raw input type, not on the flattened result length. The "alternatives expansion" pass for legality validation should remain unchanged.

**Verification**: Re-run `node scripts/debug/data-validator.mjs`; the P2 "inconsistent format" finding should disappear (or only fire if a real CSV is added).

**Title**: 29 of 31 mart/dept catalog items (potion, superPotion, X items, orbs, etc.) have no entry in `data/items.json`

**Evidence**:
```js
// battle.html POKEMART_ITEMS + DEPT_ITEMS (verified ids):
// pokeBall    -> items.json: present (pokeball)
// greatBall   -> items.json: present (greatball)
// potion, superPotion, hyperPotion, maxPotion, fullRestore, fullHeal,
// ether, elixir, maxElixir, xAttack, xDefense, xSpAtk, xSpDef, xSpeed,
// xAccuracy, direHit, guardSpec, revivalHerb, revive, maxRevive,
// sunOrb, rainOrb, hailOrb, sandOrb, electricOrb, grassyOrb,
// psychicOrb, mistyOrb, emergencyTeleporter -> ALL MISSING from items.json
```

**Repro**: `node -e` lookup against `data/items.json` flattened keys for each mart id reports MISSING for everything except `pokeBall` and `greatBall`. See `battle.html:28876-28910`.

**Blast radius**: The mart catalog is self-contained (each row has `id`, `name`, `desc`, `effect`), so the shop works fine without items.json. The only consumer that reaches into items.json is the tooltip dictionary in `loadGameData` (sets `tooltipDict[it.name] = it.shortDesc`); mart items use their own `desc` field, so this works too. However, any future feature that uniformly walks `items.json` to render bag UI, drop tables, or inventory analytics will see a phantom-item population — bag items and held items live in two disjoint universes.

**Fix sketch**: Either (a) add the 29 missing entries to `data/items.json` so the catalog is the single source of truth for item metadata; or (b) document explicitly in a `data/README.md` (or schema note) that `items.json` covers only held-items / berries and that bag/shop consumables live exclusively in `POKEMART_ITEMS` and `DEPT_ITEMS`. Option (b) is much cheaper and matches the historical architecture.

**Verification**: If option (a), the mart-coverage check (added to `scripts/debug/data-validator.mjs`) should pass. If option (b), the README addition is the deliverable; no code change.

**Title**: `isPokeball` flag set on 28 items but never read by the engine — dead metadata

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ grep -n "isPokeball\|isPokeBall" battle.html
# (no matches)
$ grep -c "isPokeball" data/items.json
28
```

**Repro**: `grep -nE "isPokeball|isPokeBall" /home/user/battle/battle.html` returns no lines (note: the mandate's spelling is `isPokeBall` with uppercase B, but the actual data uses `isPokeball`). The engine's ball-handling code uses its own `ballKey: 'master' | 'great' | ...` taxonomy in `POKEMART_ITEMS` rows, not the data-file flag.

**Blast radius**: None at runtime — the flag is just inert bytes in the JSON. It's a low-priority data-hygiene concern: future contributors may add a poke-ball entry and forget the (unused) flag, or be confused about which catalog is authoritative. Doc/maintenance friction only.

**Fix sketch**: Either (a) strip the `isPokeball` field from `data/items.json` as part of a periodic data-cleanup pass; or (b) wire the engine's ball-detection helpers (e.g., `_ballChip` flows, `applyBallMultiplier`) to read from the data file's `isPokeball` instead of the ad-hoc `kind:'ball'` rows in `POKEMART_ITEMS`. Option (b) consolidates ball-knowledge into one place but is a non-trivial refactor; option (a) is a one-liner script.

**Verification**: After (a): `grep -c isPokeball data/items.json` returns 0. After (b): boot a wild encounter, throw a Quick Ball at turn 1 — confirm the multiplier still triggers via the new lookup path.

**Title**: 9 legacy gen2 berries (Bitter, Burnt, Gold, Ice, Mint, Miracle, Mystery, PRZ Cure, PSN Cure) have no engine handler

**Evidence**:
```js
// items.json gen 9 entries — all marked isNonstandard:"Past":
// bitterberry, burntberry, goldberry, iceberry, mintberry, miracleberry,
// mysteryberry, przcureberry, psncureberry
$ grep -E "Bitter Berry|Burnt Berry|Gold Berry|Ice Berry|Mint Berry|Miracle Berry|Mystery Berry|PRZ Cure Berry|PSN Cure Berry" battle.html
# (no matches)
```

**Repro**: Iterate `data/items.json` flat for `isBerry: true`; for each berry name, grep `battle.html`. 68 of 77 distinct berries have at least one name reference (Sitrus, Lum, Salac, Liechi, ...). The remaining 9 are all `isNonstandard: "Past"` entries that were renamed/replaced in gen3+ (Gold Berry → Sitrus Berry, etc.).

**Blast radius**: None today — these berries cannot be held in the gen9-only engine path. The risk is purely hypothetical (a future "play gen2 OU" mode would silently no-op them). The dataset is internally consistent with the `isNonstandard:"Past"` marker.

**Fix sketch**: Optional cleanup — keep them as documented past-only data; or, if a multi-gen toggle is ever added, ship a name-aliasing table mapping legacy berries to their modern equivalents in the engine's berry handler. No action required today.

**Verification**: Decide whether to keep or alias; the current `isNonstandard:"Past"` is correctly signalling "do not instantiate."
